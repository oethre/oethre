"We lost so many souls, and it breaks my heart to see my people being slaughtered every year. No one is even given a chance! I can't stand idly by while the place I live is subjected to such violence! So, I've been thinking: Isn't there a more humane way to hinder overpopulation here in Hell? Perhaps we can create an alternative way to change souls through... redemption? Well, I think yes! So, that's what this project aims to achieve! Ladies and gentlemen, I'm opening the first of its kind! A hotel that rehabilitates sinners!"
―Charlie's pitch for the hotel, Hazbin Hotel pilot
Charlotte Morningstar, more commonly known as Charlie, is the Hellborn princess of Hell, the founder of the Happy Hotel, and the main protagonist of Hazbin Hotel.

The daughter of Lucifer Morningstar and the estranged queen of Hell, Lilith, Charlie wants to do right by her kingdom and find a way to redeem Sinners into Heaven through rehabilitation at the Hazbin Hotel.[15]

In "Curtain Call", after the defeat of Vox and the fall of his attempted rebellion, Charlie, with the help of her friends, managed to demonstrate the possibility of redemption with the first redeemed Sir Pentious, getting numerous sinners to stay at the Hotel to continue achieving redemption.                                       <img width="657" height="241" alt="بدون اسم248_20251202180938" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9892a249-0d70-4620-b6f1-108743aa529c" />
